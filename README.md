# COVID-19-Impact-on-Exams-A-First-Glance

In this repository, I will present preliminary findings of the analysis conducted on new data from the state final examination of 9th-grade students in the Russian region N. The results shed light on the changes in academic performance that occurred after the pandemic of COVID-19.

The dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of almost 300,000 records, representing individual students' results from 2017 to 2022. I utilize a growth model to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 disruption by comparing performance changes from year to year. The data from 2019-2020 is particularly significant, as exams in 2020 were conducted after the disruption of on-site learning in schools. This analysis unveils unexpected insights into the effects of the pandemic on academic performance.

To view the analysis results, refer to the attached report file.
