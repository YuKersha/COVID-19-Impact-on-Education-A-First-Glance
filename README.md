# COVID-19-Impact-on-Education-A-First-Glance

This repository presents preliminary findings of an analysis on new data from the state final examination of 9th-grade students in a Russian region. The dataset includes nearly 300,000 records of students' test results from 2017 to 2022. A multilevel growth model is used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on academic achievement, with a focus on the 2019-2020 data when tests were conducted amidst disruptions to on-site learning. The results uncover unexpected changes in academic performance following the COVID-19 pandemic.
